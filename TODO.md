# Admin Authentication & API Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Fixed 401 Unauthorized Errors
- **Issue**: API requests were missing Authorization headers
- **Root Cause**: `setupAxiosInterceptors` function existed but was never called
- **Solution**:
  - ✅ Added `setupAxiosInterceptors(store)` call in `fe/src/main.jsx`
  - ✅ Fixed token key from `state.user?.token` to `state.user?.accessToken` in `apiService.js`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Authentication now works properly

### 2. Fixed React Key Warning
- **Issue**: "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop" in AdminPromotions
- **Solution**:
  - ✅ Changed key from `promotion.id` to `promotion.id || \`promotion-${index}\``
  - ✅ Added fallback values for `usedCount` and `usageLimit` to prevent division by zero
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - No more React warnings

### 3. Fixed 400 Bad Request Error
- **Issue**: Coupon creation failing with 400 error
- **Root Cause**: Frontend sending wrong field names to backend
- **Solution**: Updated field mapping in AdminPromotions.jsx:
  - ✅ `type` → `discountType`
  - ✅ `value` → `discountValue`
  - ✅ `status` → `isActive`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Coupon creation should now work
